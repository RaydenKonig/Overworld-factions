**Describe the bug**
What is the bug about?

**Where can we find the bug?**
Add one or more of the following, more info helps:
- Biome name (pretty much always)
- Object name
- Generator name
- Entity name
- Region name
- Dimension component
- Etc.

**Expected behavior**
How you would rather see this be (improvement)

**Screenshots**
Adding a visualisation to your bug report is the easiest way for us to see what you mean.
It's best to use a studio world so we can see the menu on the right, which has info about the biome.

**Additional context**
Add any other context about the problem here.
